# Anomaloscope for Thesis Project

Welcome to the repository for my thesis project, an advanced anomaloscope simulation aimed at enhancing our understanding and testing of color vision deficiencies. This project was developed as part of my Master's thesis and is published on [Itch.io](https://alexandro458.itch.io/prototipo-anomaloscopio).

## Project Overview

This anomaloscope simulation is designed to assess and illustrate how individuals with color vision deficiencies perceive colors. The project uses the LMS (Long, Medium, Short wavelength) color model to closely simulate the color processing of the human eye.

### Key Features

- **LMS Color Model**: Utilizes the Long, Medium, and Short wavelength sensitive cones model to accurately represent human color vision, providing a scientific basis for color perception in the simulation.
- **Color Vision Deficiencies**: Focuses on three typical forms of color blindness (Protanopia, Deutanopia, and Tritanopia), each representing a unique challenge in color perception related to the deficiency of different types of cones.
- **Adapted Colors**: Colors within the test are specifically adapted to account for deficient cones, maximizing the effectiveness and accuracy of the anomaloscope in diagnosing color vision deficiencies.

## Implementation

The simulation is built using Unity, leveraging its powerful rendering capabilities to create a realistic and interactive environment for users to test their color vision. By adjusting the simulation parameters, users can experience how various color vision deficiencies affect their perception of color.

## Usage

To try the simulation, please visit the [Anomaloscope Prototype on Itch.io](https://alexandro458.itch.io/prototipo-anomaloscopio). The simulation is web-based and accessible through any modern browser, allowing for easy access and widespread use.
